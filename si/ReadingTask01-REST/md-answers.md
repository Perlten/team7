# Reading Task 01 - REST

By Michael Due (cph-mp447)

## Exercise

In year 2000, the software engineer and researcher Roy Fielding (https://roy.gbiv.com/) published his PhD thesis (https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), entitled Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, in which he introduced and defined the concept behind the now so popular abbreviation REST.

Read the document and find out the answers of the following questions:

1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?

2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?

3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?

4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?

Submit the answers in Peergrade and read the answers of at least three of your colleagues, to validate your and their vision.

This task is individual and brings you five credits.
